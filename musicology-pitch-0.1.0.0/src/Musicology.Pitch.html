Module: Musicology.Pitch
Description: Representations and operations for musical pitch.
Copyright: Christoph Finkensiep, 2021

Maintainer: chfin@chfin.de
Stability: experimental

This package provides useful representations and operations for working with musical pitch.
Follows the same API and notation formats as the companion libraries:

- [Pitches.jl](https://github.com/DCMLab/Pitches.jl/) (Julia)
- [purescript-pitches](https://github.com/DCMLab/purescript-pitches) (Purescript)
- [rust-pitches](https://github.com/DCMLab/rust-pitches) (Rust)
- [pitchtypes](https://github.com/DCMLab/pitchtypes) (Python)


The two main goals are:

- providing types and operations (such as arithmetics, printing and parsing) for common types of pitches and intervals
- providing a generic interface for writing code that is agnostic to the specific pitch or interval types.

It allows you to write generic algorithms that can then be applied to pitches and intervals in different formats:


&gt; import           Data.Foldable                  ( forM_ )
&gt; import           Data.Maybe                     ( catMaybes )
&gt; import           Musicology.Pitch
&gt; 
&gt; -- do something with a list of pitches
&gt; transposeAndAddOctave :: Interval i =&gt; [Pitch i] -&gt; i -&gt; [Pitch i]
&gt; transposeAndAddOctave pitches by = map (\p -&gt; p +^ by +^ octave) pitches
&gt; 
&gt; main :: IO ()
&gt; main = do
&gt;   -- perform the algorithm with MIDI pitches
&gt;   putStrLn &quot;MIDI:&quot;
&gt;   let midiPitches = midip &lt;$&gt; [60, 64, 67]
&gt;   forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave midiPitches 3)
&gt;     $ \p -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;- &quot; &lt;&gt; showNotation p
&gt; 
&gt;   -- perform the algorithm with MIDI pitch classes
&gt;   putStrLn &quot;MIDI classes:&quot;
&gt;   let midiPitches = midipc &lt;$&gt; [0, 4, 7]
&gt;   forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave midiPitches (mic 3))
&gt;     $ \p -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;- &quot; &lt;&gt; showNotation p
&gt; 
&gt;   -- perform the algorithm with spelled pitches
&gt;   putStrLn &quot;spelled:&quot;
&gt;   let spelledPitches :: [SPitch]
&gt;       spelledPitches = catMaybes $ readNotation &lt;$&gt; [&quot;C4&quot;, &quot;Eb4&quot;, &quot;G#4&quot;, &quot;C5&quot;]
&gt;       Just interval  = readNotation &quot;M3:0&quot;
&gt;   forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave spelledPitches interval)
&gt;     $ \p -&gt; putStrLn $ &quot;- &quot; &lt;&gt; showNotation p

Output:

&gt; MIDI:
&gt; - p75
&gt; - p79
&gt; - p82
&gt; MIDI classes:
&gt; - ic3
&gt; - ic7
&gt; - ic10
&gt; spelled:
&gt; - E5
&gt; - G5
&gt; - B&#9839;5
&gt; - E6

The fundamental idea behind this library is that the central object is the /interval/.
Pitches are derived from intervals by interpreting them with respect to a reference point.
This is much like the relation between vectors (= intervals) and points (= pitches).
For example, the pitch @E&#9837;4@ can be represented as an interval (e.g. a minor third, @m3:0@)
above a reference pitch such as Middle C (@C4@).
The concept of an interval is represented by the 'Interval' class.
Pitches are represented using the generic 'Pitch' type.
Pitch types for concrete interval types, however, may provide specialized functionality
(e.g. for reading and printing) as well as type synonyms
(e.g. 'SPitch' for @Pitch Snterval@).

Similar to vectors and points, intervals and pitches support a number of operations
such as addition and scalar multiplication,
which are here implemented using the 'Interval' class and its superclasses (e.g. 'VectorSpace').

For the general pitch and interval interface, have a look at &quot;Musicology.Pitch.Class&quot;.
Documentation for spelled and MIDI types
can be found in &quot;Musicology.Pitch.Spelled&quot; and &quot;Musicology.Pitch.Midi&quot;, respectively.
