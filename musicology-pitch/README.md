This package provides useful representations and operations for working with musical pitch.
Follows the same API and notation formats as the companion libraries:
- [Pitches.jl](https://github.com/DCMLab/Pitches.jl/) (Julia)
- [purescript-pitches](https://github.com/DCMLab/purescript-pitches) (Purescript)
- [rust-pitches](https://github.com/DCMLab/rust-pitches) (Rust)
- [pitchtypes](https://github.com/DCMLab/pitchtypes) (Python)


The two main goals are:

- providing types and operations (such as arithmetics, printing and parsing) for common types of pitches and intervals
- providing a generic interface for writing code that is agnostic to the specific pitch or interval types.

It allows you to write generic algorithms that can then be applied to pitches and intervals in different formats:

```haskell
import           Data.Foldable                  ( forM_ )
import           Data.Maybe                     ( catMaybes )
import           Musicology.Pitch

-- do something with a list of pitches
transposeAndAddOctave :: Interval i => [Pitch i] -> i -> [Pitch i]
transposeAndAddOctave pitches by = map (\p -> p +^ by +^ octave) pitches

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- perform the algorithm with MIDI pitches
  putStrLn "MIDI:"
  let midiPitches = midip <$> [60, 64, 67]
  forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave midiPitches 3)
    $ \p -> putStrLn $ "- " <> showNotation p

  -- perform the algorithm with MIDI pitch classes
  putStrLn "MIDI classes:"
  let midiPitches = midipc <$> [0, 4, 7]
  forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave midiPitches (mic 3))
    $ \p -> putStrLn $ "- " <> showNotation p

  -- perform the algorithm with spelled pitches
  putStrLn "spelled:"
  let spelledPitches :: [SPitch]
      spelledPitches = catMaybes $ readNotation <$> ["C4", "Eb4", "G#4", "C5"]
      Just interval  = readNotation "M3:0"
  forM_ (transposeAndAddOctave spelledPitches interval)
    $ \p -> putStrLn $ "- " <> showNotation p
```

Output:

```
MIDI:
- p75
- p79
- p82
MIDI classes:
- pc3
- pc7
- pc10
spelled:
- E5
- G5
- Bâ™¯5
- E6
```
